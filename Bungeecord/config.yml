# Skungee (Bungeecord) - The #1 Skript addon for Bungeecord.

# The version is to help determine which version this configuration is.
# Please do not modify this value, it may result in the configuration resetting!
version: "@version@"

# This is the main port for the Skungee network system. Skungee will setup this port on this Bungeecord machine.
# Make sure the port is "port forward/open" or that you have access to this port to be running, if not change this to an available port.

# If you don't know what ports you can access, contact your hosting company and ask for some ports.
# You can say "May I get some Votifier ports" to make it more clear to them, and they should give you a few ports. Normally all 4 digit ports above 1000 are available to you.
# Just be advised if it doesn't work, the ports aren't avalible or are already in use.

# Make sure all the port options of the Skungee's on the connected Spigot servers are matching this.
port: 1337

# Prints additional information in the console. The developers of Skungee may ask you to enable this when reporting an error.
debug: true

# Ignores the packets that spam such as GLOBALSCRIPTS and HEARTBEAT in the debug.
# Developers of Skungee may notify you to disable this option when reporting an error.
IgnoreSpamPackets: true

# All security options to protect your Skungee on Bungeecord and Spigot from possible external sources.
# Everything in this section must match the same values as the Skungee config.yml on the Spigot servers.
security:
    # Debug option for security, a Skungee developer may ask you to enable this.
    debug: true
    # All strings get decoded in UTF_8, some symbols may not apply.
    password:
        # Should all packets require a password in order to be processed.
        enabled: false
        # Password can't be "hashed" unless instructed too (read below)
        password: "insert password"
        # Should Skungee add a protected hash to the password using a one-way encryption.
        # This makes the password nearly impossible to decode if an external source somehow gets their hands on the packet.
        hash: true
        # If the hashFile option is true, set the password and then restart the server.
        # Skungee will create a hashed file in the Skungee folder location containing your password in a hashed format.
        # Keep in mind that the hash option above needs to be set to true.
        # After the file has been generated, set the password option above to "hashed" (Case sensitive)
        # Skungee will remember your original password until you change the password to anything other than "hashed" and this will be repeated.
        # This creates a more secure system so that if someone invades your servers files, your Skungee password is protected and all your Skungee servers aswell.
        # If you require any assistance with this option, please contact a Skungee developer.
        hashFile: false
        # Choose which algorithm you would like to use for the hash.

        cipherKey: "insert 16 length"
        # Should Skungee print any errors that may happen.
        # If you come across any errors with encryption, make sure you message the developers of Skungee, and not to users in a public setting.
        printEncryptionErrors: true
    breaches:
        # Breaches are even more added security, Breaches require the password or encryption option to be enabled for this to work.
        # Breaches is a system designed to stop constant failed attempts. Since there is no threshold for how many packets can be sent a tick, this option aims to add
        # security for that. If a(n) IP/Server fails X amount of times, what should Skungee do to protect your server. Choose from the options below.

        # Should Skungee shutdown the server if there is such an issue of security breaching?
        # Keep in mind that someone could use this to shutdown your server, this option should only be used if you really trust the security of your server
        # or that you have files and data that you really want to protect. We suggest not enabling it, but it's here for anyone who wants hardcore security.
        # This option is also good to be used if your server is private.
        shutdown: false

Recievers:

    allowedTrys: 10

# The system that tracks and manages when servers go online and offline. This system determines many things and here are the configurations for it. 
Tracker:
    # How many times should Skungee (Bungeecord) check before determining a server is offline.

# If you have scripts in the folder Bungeecord/plugins/Skungee/scripts/
# Skungee will relay these scripts to all connected servers.
# This acts like global scripts to keep all servers up to date.
# All connected servers need to have the "Reciever" option enabled in the Skungee settings.
# If you place folders within the scripts folder, they will be routed to the server that the folder is named.
# Example: Bungeecord/plugins/Skungee/scripts/Hub/ will only go to the server named "Hub" aswell as any scripts in Bungeecord/plugins/Skungee/scripts/
GlobalScripts:
    Enabled: true
    # Charset is the set of characters to use. If you would like symbols and such, you can adjust that setting here.
    # By default special symbols outside of the UTF-8 aren't supported. It's the default of your Java machine.
    # Charsets are by follows:
    #   default - The default charset of this Java virtual machine.
    #   US-ASCII - Seven-bit ASCII, a.k.a. ISO646-US, a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode character set
    #   ISO-8859-1 - ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a. ISO-LATIN-1
    #   UTF-8 - Eight-bit UCS Transformation Format
    #   UTF-16BE - Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, big-endian byte order
    #   UTF-16LE - Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, little-endian byte order
    #   UTF-16 - Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, byte order identified by an optional byte-order mark

# Bungeecord events. This also needs to be disabled on the Spigot servers if you're disabling this option.
Events: true

# To be honest the "[on] bungee[[ ]cord] [server list] ping" event can be very laggy on your server, if you have a high player database Skungee will be working hard.
# Everytime a user clicks the "Refresh" button in the multiplayer server list or that lists updates, this event will get called as the client is trying to get the motd.
# This can add up to be alot of event calls. If you have a high core machine you may not have to worry as Skungee handles most of itself in async threads.
# But this configuration node also determines the Spigot side Skungee event handler, the event is handled async and Spigot handles it back to the synced thread.
# So it's up to you, you have been informed about the side effects of using this event, it may also appear slower than normal in the server list for some users.
# This slowness is something that can't really be changed due to how Skungee has to work with Skript. We have tested on a 1,000 player database which is small, and it kept up.
DisablePingEvent: false

# Should Skungee use the UUID's that are incoming from Spigot servers.
# If you run bungeecord in offline mode for cracked players, it's best to keep this on false.
# If this option is false, only the name of players will be determined.

# NOTE: Please make sure you have the option `bungeecord` set to true in the spigot.yml of all the servers connected to this bungeecord.
# You also need to have the option `ip_forward` set to true in the config.yml of Bungeecord for this to work properly.

NetworkVariables:

    AllowOverrides: true
    # Automatic sharing means that Skungee will try to make Skungee's (Spigot side) variables
    # match the exact variables that the Skungee (Bungeecord) has.
    # So basically if you update a global variable, Skungee will make every Spigot server variables match that.
    # So all you need todo is
    #
    # set network variable {test} to "Hello world!"
    #
    # Then on every other server, the variable {test} will be be set to "Hello world!"
    #
    # WARNING: Keep in mind this will override any variable names that match Skungee's.
    # If this is enabled Skungee variable names will be priority!
    # It should be harmless if you don't care about your old data.
    # And last thing, this is cap sensitive, can't change or fix that. That's Skript. (Has been taken into consideration and fixed in Bensku's edit)

Packets:
